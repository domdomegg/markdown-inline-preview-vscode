# This is a sample

You can see the raw markdown in src/test/sample.md

We can use **bold** and _italic_ formatting.

<https://example.com> is a link.

[This is another link](https://example.com)

[This is another link with a long alias and also a long link that would create clutter and is a good test case both to demonstrate the value and to test the implementation](https://example.com/some/really/long/path/that/just/keeps/going/on/and/on/and/on?with=query&parameters=too&stuff=like&this=is&a=test&yadayadayadayada=foobarbarfoofoobarbarfoo).

A sentence with `inline code` in it.

A block of code:

```
# this is a code comment
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

This is a [reference-style link][ref1].

This is another [reference link][ref2] with text after.

This a [reference link] [ref3] with a space before the reference.

This uses an [implicit reference].

[ref1]: https://example.com
[ref2]: https://example.com/path "Optional Title"
[ref3]: https://example.com/another-path
[implicit reference]: https://example.com/implicit
