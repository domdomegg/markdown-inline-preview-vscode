# typescript-library-template

Personal template for creating TypeScript libraries.

## Quick start

1. If it should be published to NPM, add the `NPM_TOKEN` secret (make sure not to leave a trailing newline in there!). Otherwise, add `"private": true` in `package.json`.
2. Update the package name, description and repo URL in `package.json`
3. Enable 'Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests' in _Settings > Actions (General) > `Workflow permissions_
4. Add the repo to the [file sync automation rules](https://github.com/domdomegg/domdomegg/blob/master/.github/workflows/repo-file-sync.yaml)
5. Update the README, using the template commented out below
